# TTY diary

just date selector with `selected date file preview` and editing it in `$EDITOR`


## TODO:
- [ ] rewrite my `notes-alarm` bash script to go as `tty-diary-daemon`


---

It depends on [datepicker](https://github.com/maraloon/datepicker) bubble, which you can use in your go apps too
Also see [pickdate](https://github.com/maraloon/pickdate) as cli-wrapper of datepicker
